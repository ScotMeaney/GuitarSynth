# Guitar-Synth

This repository contains the Csound and Cabbage code for a guitar-processing tool that allows guitar players to control a synthesiser with their guitar.

The tool uses Csound for audio processing and Cabbage for the user interface. It performs real-time pitch detection and generates a corresponding synthesiser sound.

**Note:** The synthesiser's oscillator code is adapted from [https://github.com/mikerodd/csoundj2/blob/master/alpha-juno2.csd]. The pitch detection and UI were developed by me.

This tool was a case study for my thesis, "Towards a Framework for Interface Design in Novel Audio Tools".
